# c-embedded-foundations
A collection of C programming exercises aimed at building strong foundations for embedded and firmware development. Includes time conversion, mathematical computations, structures, pointers, and memory-aware coding practices, written with an embedded-systems mindset.

## Topics Covered
- Data types and type promotion
- Functions and control flow
- Structures
- Pointers and memory concepts
- Embedded-style problem solving

## Purpose
This repository is part of a structured training path toward professional
firmware development, including ESP32, ESP-IDF, and FreeRTOS.

## Exercises
### Basics
- `hms_to_seconds.c` — Convert hours/minutes/seconds to total seconds  
- `x_pwr_y.c` — Compute xⁿ with loops

...

## How to Build / Run
This repo uses standard C tools:

```bash
gcc basics/hms_to_seconds.c -o hms_to_seconds
./hms_to_seconds
